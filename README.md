# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects that explore customer behavior analysis, sentiment analysis, time series forecasting, and cross-selling strategies. Each project is designed to provide actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making in various business areas.

## Project Overviews

### 1. **Customer Churn Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Identify key factors driving customer churn to improve retention.
   - **Methods**: Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree analysis.
   - **Key Findings**: High churn among users without security features and those on month-to-month contracts.
   - **Outcome**: Recommendations for targeted retention efforts based on churn risk factors.

### 2. **Customer Tenure Prediction Using Decision Trees**
   - **Objective**: Predict customer tenure to understand loyalty drivers.
   - **Methods**: Decision Tree Regression and feature selection.
   - **Key Findings**: High bandwidth usage and online security presence are associated with longer tenure.
   - **Outcome**: Insights into enhancing customer loyalty through service improvements.

### 3. **Market Basket Analysis for Cross-Selling**
   - **Objective**: Identify commonly purchased product combinations to optimize cross-selling strategies.
   - **Methods**: Association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm.
   - **Key Findings**: Strong associations between certain tech accessories, ideal for bundling.
   - **Outcome**: Cross-selling strategies to improve customer experience and drive additional revenue.

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis Using RNN and NLP**
   - **Objective**: Analyze customer sentiment from reviews to improve customer satisfaction.
   - **Methods**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM, NLP for text processing.
   - **Key Findings**: Model accurately distinguishes positive from negative feedback, enabling real-time sentiment monitoring.
   - **Outcome**: Sentiment-based insights for proactive customer engagement and satisfaction improvement.

### 5. **Revenue Forecasting Using ARIMA**
   - **Objective**: Forecast daily revenue trends to assist with financial planning for a telecom company.
   - **Methods**: Time Series Analysis using ARIMA, capturing trends and seasonality.
   - **Key Findings**: Predictable seasonal patterns support short-term revenue projections.
   - **Outcome**: Data-driven planning for budget allocation, promotional strategies, and staffing adjustments.

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
