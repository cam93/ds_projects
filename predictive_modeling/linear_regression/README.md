# Customer Tenure Analysis Project

This project examines factors influencing customer tenure in a telecom dataset, aiming to identify variables that significantly contribute to long-term customer retention. By applying multiple linear regression, this analysis provides insights into which attributes impact customer loyalty, helping to develop effective retention strategies.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The research question guiding this analysis is:
**"What factors contribute most to customer tenure?"**

### Goals
1. **Identify Key Drivers**: Determine which variables (e.g., demographics, service usage) significantly impact customer tenure.
2. **Enhance Retention**: Use insights to develop strategies for customer engagement, targeted marketing, and product offerings to boost long-term customer retention.

## Data and Methodology

### Key Variables
- **Dependent Variable**: Tenure (in months)
- **Independent Variables**: Include age, income, bandwidth usage, customer interactions, equipment failure, family size, monthly charges, and tech-related services.

### Analytical Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, converted categorical variables, addressed multicollinearity, and scaled data to prepare it for analysis.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Modeled the relationship between tenure and various predictors, using a reduced model approach with feature selection (SelectKBest).
3. **Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics like Residual Standard Error (RSE) and Adjusted R-squared to determine the balance between complexity and predictive power.

## Results Summary

- **Regression Findings**: The reduced model identified significant predictors of tenure, including:
  - High bandwidth usage (correlated with longer tenure)
  - Age, family size, and tech-savviness as positive indicators of loyalty
  - Equipment failures, when resolved, associated with increased customer satisfaction and loyalty

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - **Initial Model RSE**: 0.0512
  - **Reduced Model RSE**: 0.0606 (small increase, acceptable trade-off for model simplicity)

### Recommendations
Based on analysis insights, consider these strategies to improve customer tenure:
1. **Tailored Offers**: Target high bandwidth users with loyalty programs or discounts.
2. **Enhanced Support**: Strengthen support for equipment issues to increase satisfaction.
3. **Segmented Campaigns**: Customize campaigns for older and tech-savvy customers.
4. **Family-Focused Plans**: Design and market family-oriented services.
5. **Pricing Adjustments**: Explore flexible pricing and discounts for long-term commitments.
