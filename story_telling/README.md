# Interactive Customer Churn Dashboard Analysis

This project leverages interactive data visualization to analyze customer churn in a telecom dataset. Using Tableau, it combines internal and external datasets to provide stakeholders with insights into churn rates, service preferences, and competitive benchmarking. By comparing internal data with similar customer data from Kaggle, this dashboard offers a strategic view of retention drivers and improvement opportunities.

## Project Overview
